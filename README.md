# Central Limite Theorem (CLT) - demostration

shinyR demo to illustrate how the distribution of sample means becomes Gaussian with increasing sample size.  If one takes random samples of size n from a population of mean(u) and standard deviation (mu), then as n gets large, sample mean approachs the normal distribution with mean (u) and standard deviation mu/sqrt(n). 

# Installation and Usage:  

```{r}
install.packages("shiny")
library("shiny")
runApp("sample_means")
